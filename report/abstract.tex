Since 1995 many extra solar planets have been discovered using the transit method. I have shown that it is possible to detect these planets using relatively low powered ground based optical telescopes (<0.5m), even under very poor seeing conditions. I also present an algorithm for analysing images and a computer program implementation of this algorithm, including an automated pipeline for processing a large sequence of images. Using this computer program, it was determined that the dwarf star, Hat P 20, has a planet of radius $(0.91\pm0.14) R_J$.
