\subsection{Observations}

Unfortunately due to poor weather I have so far been unable to collect any new data of my own, and have so far just worked with data from previous attempts at this project. Hopefully I will be able to collect data of my own for known transits to demonstrate that the methods I have described work. After this I would like to collect data attempting to find new transit candidates.

\subsection{Fully automated photometry}

While much of the software pipeline is automated, there can be further improvements here.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Automatically attempt to fit transit curve to all stars in image
    \item Analyse the curves to find transit candidates
\end{enumerate}

Ideally I would like to be able to capture images for an entire night with a wide field of view, and then see if there are any as of yet unknown planetary transits that can be further investigated.
